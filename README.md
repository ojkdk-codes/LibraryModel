# LibraryModel
LibraryModel is a Java-based library management system that organizes books using a binary search tree (BST). It allows users to insert books, search for a book by name, and find the book with the smallest name in lexicographical order.

In order for this progream to run correctly, the input file should be in below format:
book-name,isbn,yyyy-mm-dd
Book Name,ISBN,YYYY-MM-DD
